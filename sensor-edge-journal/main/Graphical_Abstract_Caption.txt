In this research, we present the concept of a hybrid floating-point quantization and its dedicated hardware design for high-quality and low-power sensor analytics. Suitable for TinyML, this approach reduces latency, memory footprint, and power dissipation while preserving inference accuracy. The proposed hardware/software co-design is integrated with TensorFlow Lite in a cost-optimized embedded FPGA.
