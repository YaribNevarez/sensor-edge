In the literature we find plenty of hardware architectures
dedicated to CNN accelerators implemented in FPGA and ASIC designs. However the related work on low-power and resource-limited devices is reduced. To the best of our knowledge, two research papers have been reported hardware implementations targeting XC7Z007S as the smallest device from Zynq-7000 SoC Family.

In \cite{gao2020edgedrnn}, Chang Gao et al., presented EdgeDRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN) accelerator for edge inference. This implementation adopts the spiking neural network (SNN) inspired delta network algorithm to exploit temporal sparsity in RNNs. However, this hardware architecture is dedicated to RNNs.

In \cite{meloni2019cnn}, Paolo Meloni et al., presented a CNN inference accelerator for compact and cost-optimized devices. This implementation uses fixed-point for processing light-weight CNN architectures with a power efficiency between 2.49 to 2.98 GOPS/s/W.
