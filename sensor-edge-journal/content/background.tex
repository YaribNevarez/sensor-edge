\subsection{Conv2D tensor operation}
The \emph{Conv2D} tensor operation is described in \Equ{eq:conv2D}, where $h$ is the input feature map, $W$ is the convolution kernel (known as filter), and $b$ is the bias for the output feature map\cite{goodfellow2016deep}. We denote \emph{Conv} as \emph{Conv2D} operator.
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:conv2D}
Conv\left(W,h\right)_{i,j,o}=\sum_{k,l,m}^{K,L,M} h_{(i+k,j+l,m)} W_{(o,k,l,m)}+b_{o}
\end{eqnarray} 	
\subsection{DepthwiseConv2D tensor operation}
The \emph{DepthwiseConv2D} tensor operation is described in \Equ{eq:dconv2D}, where $h$ is the input feature map, $W$ is the convolution kernel (known as filter), and $b$ is the bias for the output feature map. We denote \emph{DConv} as \emph{DepthwiseConv2D} operator.
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:dconv2D}
DConv\left(W,h\right)_{i,j,n}=\sum_{k,l}^{K,L} h_{(i+k,j+l,n)} W_{(k,l,n)}+b_{n}
\end{eqnarray}
