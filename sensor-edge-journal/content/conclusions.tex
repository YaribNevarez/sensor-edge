\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper, we present a design exploration framework for floating-point CNNs acceleration on low-power, resource-limited embedded FPGAs. This design targets inexpensive IoT and near-sensor data analytic applications. We propose a scalable hardware architecture with customizable tensor processors integrated with TensorFlow Lite. The implemented hardware optimization realizes a pipelined vector dot-product using hybrid custom floating-point and logarithmic approximation with fully parametrized on-chip memory utilization. This approach accelerates computation, reduces energy consumption and resource utilization. We proposed a quantized-aware training method to maintain and increase inference accuracy with custom reduced floating-point formats. This approach is fundamentally more efficient compared to equivalent fixed-point number representations. Experimental results on XC7Z007S (MiniZed) and XC7Z010 (Zybo) demonstrate peak acceleration and power efficiency of 105X and 5.5 GFLOP/s/W, respectively.
