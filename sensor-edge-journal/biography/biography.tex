\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{../biography/Beering_bw_klein.jpeg}}]{Andreas Beering} received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Information Engineering  from the University of Bremen, Germany, in 2015 and 2017, respectively. He is currently working towards a Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Electrodynamics and Microelectronics at the University of Bremen, Germany. His research interests focus mainly on signal processing and classification of vibration signals. In addition to the analysis of passive acoustic emission for monitoring gearboxes and processes, the second focus lies on active ultrasonic investigations.
In this context, ultrasonic waveforms for monitoring overmoulding processes are being investigated.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{../biography/krieger.jpg}}]{Karl-Ludwig Krieger} received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in 1999 from the University of Bremen, Germany. Dr. Krieger worked from 1998-2009 as a manager in the field of function and algorithm development for powertrain systems at Daimler AG in Stuttgart. Since 2009 he has been a full professor for the chair of Electronic Vehicle and Mobility Systems at the University of Bremen, Germany. The research focus of his chair is primarily on the analysis of vibration and ultrasound signals in different application fields, for example, passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, mobile working machines or industrial machines. Further research priorities of the chair are near-infrared spectral sensors and capacitive sensor systems for different fields of application. These research topics are worked on in close cooperation with leading industrial partners and are mainly financed from third-party funds.
